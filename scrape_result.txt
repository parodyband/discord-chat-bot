Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.[3]Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in thatenergy,momentum,angular momentum, and other quantities of aboundsystem are restricted todiscrete values(quantization); objects have characteristics of bothparticlesandwaves(wave–particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (theuncertainty principle).Quantum mechanicsarose graduallyfrom theories to explain observations that could not be reconciled with classical physics, such asMax Planck's solution in 1900 to theblack-body radiationproblem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency inAlbert Einstein's1905 paper, which explained thephotoelectric effect. These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the "old quantum theory", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s byNiels Bohr,Erwin Schrödinger,Werner Heisenberg,Max Born,Paul Diracand others. The modern theory is formulated in variousspecially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical entity called thewave functionprovides information, in the form ofprobability amplitudes, about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield.Overview and fundamental conceptsQuantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems. It is typically applied to microscopic systems: molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles. It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms,[4]but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such asWigner's friend, and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative.[5]Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree ofaccuracy.[note 1]A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities. Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of acomplex number, known as a probability amplitude. This is known as theBorn rule, named after physicistMax Born. For example, a quantum particle like anelectroncan be described by awave function, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude. Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives aprobability density functionfor the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it. This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found. TheSchrödinger equationrelates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.One consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in predictability between different measurable quantities. The most famous form of thisuncertainty principlesays that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise prediction for a measurement of its position and also at the same time for a measurement of itsmomentum.Another consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is the phenomenon ofquantum interference, which is often illustrated with thedouble-slit experiment. In the basic version of this experiment, acoherent light source, such as alaserbeam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate.[6]: 102–111[2]: 1.1–1.8The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits tointerfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles.[6]However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles rather than waves; the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detectedphotonpasses through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave).[6]: 109[7][8]However,such experimentsdemonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. Other atomic-scale entities, such aselectrons, are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit.[2]This behavior is known aswave–particle duality.Another counter-intuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics isquantum tunnelling: a particle that goes up against apotential barriercan cross it, even if its kinetic energy is smaller than the maximum of the potential.[9]In classical mechanics this particle would be trapped. Quantum tunnelling has several important consequences, enablingradioactive decay,nuclear fusionin stars, and applications such asscanning tunnelling microscopyand thetunnel diode.[10]When quantum systems interact, the result can be the creation ofquantum entanglement: their properties become so intertwined that a description of the whole solely in terms of the individual parts is no longer possible. Erwin Schrödinger called entanglement "...thecharacteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought".[11]Quantum entanglement enables the counter-intuitive properties ofquantum pseudo-telepathy, and can be a valuable resource in communication protocols, such asquantum key distributionandsuperdense coding.[12]Contrary to popular misconception, entanglement does not allow sending signalsfaster than light, as demonstrated by theno-communication theorem.[12]Another possibility opened by entanglement is testing for "hidden variables", hypothetical properties more fundamental than the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would allow more exact predictions than quantum theory can provide. A collection of results, most significantlyBell's theorem, have demonstrated that broad classes of such hidden-variable theories are in fact incompatible with quantum physics. According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory oflocalhidden variables, then the results of aBell testwill be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way. Many Bell tests have been performed, using entangled particles, and they have shown results incompatible with the constraints imposed by local hidden variables.[13][14]It is not possible to present these concepts in more than a superficial way without introducing the actual mathematics involved; understanding quantum mechanics requires not only manipulating complex numbers, but alsolinear algebra,differential equations,group theory, and other more advanced subjects.[note 2]Accordingly, this article will present a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and survey its application to some useful and oft-studied examples.Mathematical formulationMain article:Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanicsIn the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum mechanical system is a vectorψ{\displaystyle \psi }belonging to a (separable) complexHilbert spaceH{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}. This vector is postulated to be normalized under the Hilbert space inner product, that is, it obeys⟨ψ,ψ⟩=1{\displaystyle \langle \psi ,\psi \rangle =1}, and it is well-defined up to a complex number of modulus 1 (the global phase), that is,ψ{\displaystyle \psi }andeiαψ{\displaystyle e^{i\alpha }\psi }represent the same physical system. In other words, the possible states are points in theprojective spaceof a Hilbert space, usually called thecomplex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example, for describing position and momentum the Hilbert space is the space of complexsquare-integrablefunctionsL2(C){\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {C} )}, while the Hilbert space for thespinof a single proton is simply the space of two-dimensional complex vectorsC2{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{2}}with the usual inner product.Physical quantities of interest – position, momentum, energy, spin – are represented by observables, which areHermitian(more precisely,self-adjoint) linearoperatorsacting on the Hilbert space. A quantum state can be aneigenvectorof an observable, in which case it is called aneigenstate, and the associatedeigenvaluecorresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. More generally, a quantum state will be a linear combination of the eigenstates, known as aquantum
